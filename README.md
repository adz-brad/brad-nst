# Brad Smith
### Full-stack JAM Developer

I build intelligently designed, intuitively functional web, mobile & desktop applications designed to streamline business processes, increase client satisfaction and improve overall revenue. Simply put, I build enterprise-grade applications that scale.

Currently, my favorite tools to work with include:

#### Frameworks

- React
- React Native
- Gatsby
- NextJS

#### API Services

- Apollo GraphQL
- MongoDB Atlas & Realm
- Algolia Search
- Auth0
- Twilio
- Zapier

#### CDN

- Netlify
- Vercel
- Heroku
- Gatsby Cloud

#### CMS

- Sanity
- Contentful
- Strapi
- GraphCMS

#### ECommerce

- Shopify
- Crystallize
- CommerceLayer
- Stripe
- Square


Most importantly, I love to keep an open mind to new development methodologies and push myself to constantly learn, frequently engaging with the development community to learn new skills while honing existing ones. While managing my own remote-based development company, Adrenalize Digital, I frequently take on additional freelance projects and am always open to new client inquiries to help others take their startup or business to the next level.

I look forward to and whole-heartedly embrace every new opportunity and look forward to helping more people achieve their dreams.

Cheers,

Brad S.
